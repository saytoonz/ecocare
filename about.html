			<p id="topic">ECOCARE WASTE INITIATIVES (EWI)</p>
			<p id="subtopic">OUR INNOVATIVE SOCIAL IMPACT IDEAS</p>
			<p class="headings">Description of EcoCare</p>

			<p>My team's innovative idea is to set up an organisation called <span style="font-weight: bold;"><i>EcoCare Waste Initiatives</i></span> that will approach Ghana's waste handling challenge differently from all others by imploring inclusively social, environmental and economic impact models.</p>

			<p style="font-weight: bold;"><i>The key problems we identified to solve about Ghana's waste management systems are:</i></p>

			<p>
					<span style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; padding-right: 10px;"> 1.</span> The throw-away culture of Ghanaians lead to indiscriminate disposal of municipal and industrial waste - creating huge challenge in waste collection for Zoomlion (Ghana's waste collection giant); and sanitation problems for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Town councils<br><br>

					<span style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; padding-right: 10px;"> 2.</span> Most of the rural communities and suburbs of Goaso (the capital) in the Asunafo North Municipality (where we are based) are not yet covered by the Zoomlion-Municipal Waste Management concession.<br><br>

					<span style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; padding-right: 10px;"> 3.</span> Increased pressure on landfills - where more arable lands are rather used as dump sites by the Zoomlion waste management activities<br><br>

					<span style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; padding-right: 10px;"> 4.</span> Climate change - due to increased Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from burning of wastes, and<br><br>

					<span style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; padding-right: 10px;"> 5.</span> Soil depletion and pollution of groundwater and rivers - from hazardous chemicals spillage and indiscriminate application of chemical fertilizers.
			</p>

			<br>

			<p style="font-weight: bold;"><i>What EcoCare will be doing</i></p>

			<p>EcoCare Waste Initiatives is a low-tech waste collection and recycling Community Based Organization (CBO) in Goaso, Brong Ahafo of Ghana. We are trying to address the challenges of plastic and organic waste pollution, urban waste management, unemployment, climate change, deforestation and soil depletion. We utilize waste plastic and paper as a resource to manufacture aesthetic, durable and ecologically friendly fencing and landscaping artifacts, packages and paraphernalia; as well as convert organic waste into compost soil and organic fertilizers, and supply some tonnes of waste plastics to third party recycling companies.</p>


			<br>


			<p class="headings">Our Vision</p>
			<p> <i>Our vision is</i> "To see a world without waste."</p>

			<p class="headings">Our Mission</p>
			<p> <i>Our mission is</i> "To challenge the world's wasteful paradigm and throw-away culture by giving value to waste while advocating against waste generation."</p>

			<p><i style="font-weight: bold;">Our goal</i> in the short to medium term is to create a sustainable solution to the growing plastic and organic waste menace, alternatives to landfills and chemical fertilizer while providing decent job opportunities in the environmental and sanitation sectors in our communities. 
			Our goal in the long term will be to scale up into a big social enterprise that will produce and supply Ghanaians with green energy (like solar, biogas and other biofuels) and shift Ghana's dependence on timber for furniture onto recycled plastic.
			Key strategies we use are:  to Design low-tech waste recycling ideas; Inspire people with our ideas, to challenge the wasteful paradigm; and to Promote recycled products
			"Don't Waste Your Waste", is our commitment motto to environmental excellence integrated with a business approach to sustainability.</p>


			<p class="headings">ECOCARE'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE SDGs:</p>

			<p>
				<span style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; padding-right: 10px;">SDG 5:</span> Achieving gender equality and empower all girls
				<br><br>
				<span style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; padding-right: 10px;">SDG 6:</span> Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
				<br><br>
				<span style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; padding-right: 10px;">SDG 12:</span> Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns
				<br><br>
				<span style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; padding-right: 10px;">SDG 13:</span> Take urgent actions to combat climate change and its impacts
			</p>



			<p style="font-weight: bold;"><i>How sustainable is your idea?<span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bolder;">*</span></i></p>

			<p>We hope to use the following Social, Environmental and Economic (TBL/PPP) approaches to make our project sustainable:</p>

			<p>
				<span style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; padding-right: 10px;">1.</span> In-depth Research and development activities at our "EcoCare Recycling Valley"
				<br><br>
				<span style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; padding-right: 10px;">2.</span> Run a website and an information desk to educate the world on eco-friendly waste management while promoting recycled products
				<br><br>
				<span style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; padding-right: 10px;">3.</span> Radio shows and community campaigns on how to manage waste the eco-friendly way, while marketing our recycled products and ideas
				<br><br>
				<span style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; padding-right: 10px;">4.</span> Waste collection business to make money to pay for staff and volunteers allowances and other expenses
				<br><br>
				<span style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; padding-right: 10px;">5.</span> Production and sales of recycled products to make economic profits
				<br><br>
				<span style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; padding-right: 10px;">6.</span> Organize training workshops and exhibition conferences aimed at developing creative recycling and manufacturing ideas in young people, while generating funds (IGF). 
				<br><br>
				<span style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; padding-right: 10px;">7.</span> Scaling up in future to include production of green energy like biogas; and manufacturing of plastic fence posts
				<br><br>
			</p>

			<p><b>Details of Our Enterprise: What makes a promising and Innovative Idea to be Selected for SAG-SEED Starters, GYSEC 2017, TEDxAccra pitch etc?</b></p>

			<p>
				<span style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; padding-right: 10px;">1.</span> I have a great idea with a global interest not only for the benefit of my country Ghana. This idea will be promoting recycling, waste management and environmental protection technologies; it will be addressing some components in most of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) like the SDG 6 (Ensuring water and Sanitation) and SDG 12 (Ensuring responsible production and consumption). It addresses unemployment and poverty. When we fully roll out this project, many unemployed youth will be employed at several levels on part-time and full-time. We will give value to the waste people generate as well as sell our recycled products at reasonable prices - so that the average (lower class) Ghanaian will make money and save money for better standard of living.
				<br><br>

				<span style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; padding-right: 10px;">2.</span> I have a strong motivation. I discovered after many years of being a "pack rat" that: many product packages (especially those of paper and plastic) that we use in our homes, offices and industries, usually have some after-use values that we tend to neglect. And I have always wondered what could be done to harness this neglected resource. Plastic bottles for instance are designed to carry liquids of all sort. Billions are spent on their design and product marketing. However, once a plastic drink bottle is empty it is perceived by the average Ghanaian as redundant and thrown away. So I sort to challenge this wasteful paradigm. My project philosophy and lifestyle philosophy combine to sum up my motivation for this social enterprise: "Every waste has a potential, if we challenge our wasteful paradigm we would find them."
				<br><br>

				<span style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; padding-right: 10px;">3.</span> I have a well-positioned team built and ready to help me roll out this project this year when given funding support. We are a team of six (6) young and agile people - four (4) males and two (2) females with divers experience and skills sets. I am an ecologist and conservation manager by discipline, Felix (who will be technical director) is completing the university this year as an Environmental Engineer, Frank (who will be our Finance director) has BSc in Accounting, and a practicing Banker; Isaac (in charge of Public relations and Marketing) has several years of entrepreneurial experience and Patience and Akua (in charge of education and advocacy) are both health information technicians in the Ghana Health Service and have much experience in public education.
				<br><br>

				<span style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; padding-right: 10px;">4.</span> We have a clear plan. We plan to register with the Registrar of Companies as an enterprise, and further register with the SE Ghana and be officially known as a Social Enterprise. In our business plan, we plan to roll out plastic, paper and organic waste collection, recycling and sales. We have a plan to partner later with already established waste management companies to run together some innovations as we scale up. E.g. COLIBA
				<br><br>

				<span style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; padding-right: 10px;">5.</span> Our business model has People (Social), Planet (Environmental) and Profit (Economic) as its Triple Bottom Line - to ensure our sustainability. Therefore we can become self-sustainable and we have more chance or factors for scaling up and replication in several other countries.
